### **The Project:** 

Dive in to fish out the facts! 

A classification app for your holiday snapshots or your greatest catch. Raising awareness for species conservation. 

Upload your fish image and use our Streamlit App, developed using Convolutional Neural Network & Transfer Learning. With this app you will find out all of the facts about your fish.

### **Source of the data:** 

[Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sripaadsrinivasan/fish-species-image-data) owned by Sripaad Srinivasan.
This fish species dataset, currently consisting of 3,960 images collected from 468 species, contains real-world images of fish captured in 3 conditions defined as

1. "controlled", 
2. "out-of-the-water" and 
3. "in-situ".

The "controlled", images consists of fish specimens, with their fins spread, taken against a constant background with controlled illumination.

The "in-situ" images are underwater images of fish in their natural habitat and so there is no control over background or illumination.

The "out-of-the-water" images consist of fish specimens, taken out of the water with a varying background and limited control over the illumination conditions.
